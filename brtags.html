    <p>Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks, which consequently break in pieces.<br> Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. <br>This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits.<br> The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones, often forming desert pavements, and little further erosion takes place.<br> Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water.<br> Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. <br>There may be underground sources of water, in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.</p>
